1NF : 

members can be in any order 
If we want specific order for everything we can order them 

solution : add a extra column to identity them in rankings / order 

using row order to convey information violates 1NF : we should devote a separate column to it to order 
mixing datatypes (one datatype for one column)
designing table without primary key (one row one particular value so we cant avoid multiple value for same thing)
Repeating groups 

eg : iventory : 1cup 2tables 1door 3windows (no way query) 
Storing repeated group of data items on single row 

Solution : 

userid iventorytype iventoryquantity
   1       window        3
   2        door         2
   1       table         5
   4       cups          2
   1       cups          1


2NF : 

deletion , insertion anamoly and update anamoly 
(update , insertion and delete may not happen correctly data might be lost or incorrect data representation may happen )

userid iventorytype iventoryquantity userrating 
   1       window        3          Intermediate
   2        door         2            Beginner  
   1       table         5          Intermediate 
   4       cups          2            Expert
   1       cups          1          Intermediate

userrating is getting repeated , make it into other table 


Non-key attributes : other than primary key combinations(userrating is not depended on iventorytype)

Each non - key attributes must depend on entire primary key 

New Table : 

userid userrating
  1   Intermediate
  2    Beginner 
  4     Expert 


3NF : Every non key term should only depend on the primary key or whole key


Eg to thought of adding skilllevel to users  :

1-3 - Beginner
4-7 - Intermediate
8-10 - Expert

we skill is changed we might need to change rating and it might lead to inconsistency 3 ---> 4 

userid  userrating    skill   
   1   Intermediate     6
   2    Beginner        3    ----->    we remove the middle attributes and create a new table 
   4     Expert         9

Translative dependency skill is depended on userid and userrating (non - primary key )


userid skill 
  1      6
  2      3      && 
  4      9


userskill  userrating
   1        Beginner
   2        Beginner
   3        Beginner
   4        Beginner
   5        Intermediate .....
